Analyze Kaggle competition perturbation dataset

Download data files from url https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bv7Zl3megOCMsj34lm6AeGxXG2uPLgk_

adata_train.parquet is the expression data
adata_obs_meta is the associated meta data
de_train.parquet is the (-log10(p value)*sign(logFC)) score
train_or_control_bulk_by_cell_type_adata.h5ad is described as correctly filtered AnnData
bulk_counts.Rda is the bulked data generated from Amir's code.

In the folder pseudo-bulking, there are python codes that generate clean bulked data, performing in vitro DE analysis, detailed instructions are listed below.

Kaggle_analysis.Rmd performed preliminary analysis based on bulk_counts.Rda

Kaggle_analysis_new.Rmd performs analysis on the clean bulk data which could be used to get de_train.parquet.

Instructions for using the pseudo-bulking folder:

1. Download data files in datasets folder.

2. Run pseudo-bulking.ipynb, this code will generate the clean bulked data: bulk_adata.h5ad, bulk_adata_obs.csv, bulk_adata_var.csv and bulk_adata_X.csv. The csv files are generated from the h5ad file and are used in the Kaggle_analysis_new.Rmd file. All the files are in datasets folder.

3. This code also generate input data for DE analysis (based on limma model). After running the code, 6 folder with the name "cell_type_[name]" will be created and the input file for each cell type is stored in these folders.

4. r_code.sh file will also be generated. This is the command line program that calls limma model in R. Required R files are limma_contrast.r and limma_fit.r. r_install.r contains necessary packages.

5. Run r_code.sh in terminal to get DE results. The results for each cell type will be stored under the cell type folders. These results will further used in Kaggle_analysis_new.Rmd.

6. Run Convert_input.ipynb to get csv files of the cell type DE input files (h5ad). These files are under folder input_obs.
