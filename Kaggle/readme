## Instruction for the Kaggle analysis:
## In folder pseudo-bulking, run the python code pseudo-bulking.ipynb, this will generate the bulked count data (bulk_adata.h5ad). It will also generate bash code to run limma to get the de results. The necessary R script files are limma_fit.R and limma_contrast.R in the same folder.
## Before running any codes, please download datasets in the datasets folder. Note that, the bulk_counts.Rda is pseudo-bulked data generated from Amir's code.
