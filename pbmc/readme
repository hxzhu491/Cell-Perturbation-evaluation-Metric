## In this folder, we test the new evaluation approach on pbmc data from Kang et al. 2018
## The python files are used to output csv data from h5ad, and to run scgen on the dataset.
## The rmd file is the main R code for generating plots and results.
## Currently, the outputs from data_output.ipynb are stored in the data folder (google link).
## The outputs from pbmc_scgen.ipynb are stored in the result folder (google link).
## To run the pbmc_final_revised.Rmd, need to: 
## 1. Download files from the link in the data folder
## 2. Download files from the link in the result folder
## Currently the two ipynb files are not necessary to run again.
