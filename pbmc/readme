## Perform DEG analysis with in silico models on Kang et. al 2018 data set.
## In Silico Models Used: scgen and baseline models
## Kang data is obtained from scgen
## Kang url:
## scgen url:


1. Run scgen: To reproduce scgen results, run pbmc_scgen.ipynb. This will download h5ad files from  For users not interested in rerunning scgen, results may be downloaded following link in results/ folder 

2. Download and convert Kang data sets to csv: Baseline models and comparison of models are performed in R using .csv files as input. Kang .h5ad files (NAME the files) must be downloaded (from WHERE?), converted into .csv

3. pbmc_final_revised.Rmd: Fit baseline models (uses .csv in data/) and perform differential gene expression analysis using both baseline models and scgen (scgen results read from results folder)
